                  <h3>Coppa Compliance (for Children Under 13 Users Only)</h3>
                  <p>Protecting children's privacy online is extremely important to NokOut. NokOut’s Website, Apps and Services are intended for general audience and NokOut does not knowingly collect any Personal Information as the term is defined under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). The COPPA is a federal legislation that applies to entities that collect and store Personal Information from children under the age of 13. We are committed to ensure compliance with COPPA. Our Website, Apps, and Platform are not meant for use by children under the age of 13.</p>
                  <p>Through our Apps your child will be able to receive local in-app notifications, which do not collect any Personal Information.</p>
                  <p>Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use NokOut's Platform on our Website or on the Apps, this may include such general audience communication services as email, instant messaging, and online groups, and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose Personal Information to, other Users of all ages.</p>
                  <p>If you are a parent and wish to revoke your previously provided consent, review information collected from your child or have that information deleted, please contact the NokOut support by writing an email to admin@nokoutgames.com . Information collected is secured in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. If we make material changes to how we use, collect, or share your child's Personal Information, we will notify parents by email or by providing a notification on the Platform in order to obtain verifiable parental consent for the new uses of your child's Personal Information. We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing Personal Information online. Under no circumstances do we condition a child's participation in an activity—like contests—on the child's disclosure of more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. On certain Apps, we may not permit children to participate at all regardless of having their parental consent. If you would like to know more about our practices and specifically our practices in relation to COPPA compliance, please email us at admin@nokoutgames.com.</p>
