                    <h3>7. Payment Terms</h3>
                  <p>We provide some services for real money to obtain a limited license and right to use Virtual Items and/or other goods or services.</p>
                  <p><b>How it Works:</b></p>
                  <p>You get a limited license and right to use Virtual Items by visiting the purchase page in one of our games or Services and providing billing authorization through the platform on which you are playing (e.g., Facebook, Apple, Google).</p>
                  <p>When you make a purchase on any Service offered by NokOut, the payment page will let you know what payment methods you can use to pay when you make your purchase. The price of the product will be the price indicated on the order page when you place your order. When your purchase is complete, we may send you a confirmation email that will have details of the items you have ordered. Please check that the details in the confirmation message are correct as soon as possible and keep a copy of it for your records. NokOut keeps records of transactions in order to handle any future questions about that transaction.</p>
                  <p>When you purchase Virtual Items in our games on other platforms such as Facebook, Apple, or Google, NokOut is not a party to the transaction and your purchase will be governed by the third-party platform’s payment terms and conditions. Please review the platform’s terms of service for additional information. You can also contact our Billing Support team as described below for questions concerning refunds of purchases made through Facebook or Google.</p>
                  <p>For Virtual Items, your order will represent an offer to us to obtain a limited license and right to use the relevant Service(s) or Virtual Item(s) that will be accepted by us when we accept payment. At that point, the limited license begins.</p>
                  <ul>
                      <p>For orders to obtain a limited license and right to use Virtual Items, by clicking the purchase/order button on the purchase window or page you:</p>
                      <li class="mb20">agree that we will supply the Virtual Items to you as soon as we have accepted your order; and</li>
                      <li class="mb20">if you reside in the European Union (the “EU”), you acknowledge that you will therefore no longer have the right to cancel under the EU’s Consumer Rights Directive (as implemented by the law of the country where you are located) once we start to supply the Virtual Item.</li>
                      <p>You understand that while you may “earn,” “buy,” or “purchase” Virtual Items in our Services, you do not legally “own” the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Items do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Any “virtual currency” balance shown in your Account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your limited license.</p>

                      <p><b>All sales are final:</b> Nokout is not required to provide a refund for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused virtual items when an account is closed, either voluntarily or involuntarily, or no matter which platform you made your payment through.</p>
                      <p><b>Purchases to acquire a limited license and right to use virtual items are non-refundable to the fullest extent allowed by law.</b></p>
                      <p><b>Additional Payment Terms:</b></p>
                      <p>You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an Account registered to you. NokOut may revise the pricing for the goods and services it licenses to you through the Services at any time.</p>

                <p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE NOKOUT IS NOT LIABLE</p>
                <p>(1) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR DATA, IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES; OR</p>
                <p>(2) FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICES AND OPERATORS OF EXTERNAL SITES.</p>
                <p>THE RISK OF USING THE SERVICES AND EXTERNAL SITES RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU AS DOES THE RISK OF INJURY FROM THE SERVICES AND EXTERNAL SITES.</p>
                <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY ANY LAW THAT APPLIES, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY IN THESE TERMS APPLY TO ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY CAUSED BY THE SERVICES, OR RELATED TO USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES, UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE).</p>
                <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF NOKOUT IS LIMITED TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID NOKOUT IN THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS (180) DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT ANY SUCH CLAIM.</p>
                <p>IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID NOKOUT ANY AMOUNT IN THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS (180) DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT ANY SUCH CLAIM, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH NOKOUT IS TO STOP USING THE SERVICES AND TO CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.</p>
                <p>Some states or countries do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitations/exclusions of liability described above, which means these limitations/exclusions may not apply to you if you reside in one of those states or countries.</p>
                <p>These limitations/exclusions do not apply to users located in the EEA. For those users, if NokOut fails to comply with these Terms, NokOut is responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of NokOut’s breach of these Terms or is a result of NokOut’s negligence, but NokOut is not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it was an obvious consequence of our breach or if it was contemplated by you and NokOut at the time we entered into these Terms.</p>

                <h3>14. Agreement to Arbitrate And Class Action Waiver</h3>
                <p>Before bringing a formal legal case, you must first contact our Customer Support team. In the event that you and NokOut can’t resolve the dispute through Customer Support, you and NokOut both agree to arbitrate as described below.</p>
                <p>By voluntarily accepting these Terms (and in many of our Services by voluntarily clicking or tapping an in-game button to affirmatively indicate your agreement to these Terms), you and NokOut agree to the fullest extent permitted by law to resolve any claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the Terms, Feature Terms including but not limited to your use of the Services and information you provide via the Services, through final and binding arbitration. This applies to all claims under any legal theory unless the claim fits within the Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate identified below. This agreement to arbitrate also applies even after you stop using your account or delete it. (In this Section 14 and in Section 16, you and NokOutmay be referred to individually as “a party” or collectively as “the parties.”)</p>
                <p>An arbitration proceeding is before a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge and jury, so by voluntarily accepting these Terms, you, and NokOut agree to give up the right to a trial before a judge and jury. Arbitrations have different rules from lawsuits in court. They are less formal than lawsuits in courts and provide limited opportunities to force the other side to share information relevant to the dispute—a process called discovery. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. But, if any party does not like the arbitrator’s decision, the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision.</p>
                <p>If any party disagrees about whether this Section 14 (or any portion of this Section 14 including without limitation the provisions relating to arbitration, class action waiver, and opting out) can be enforced or whether it applies to the dispute, the parties all agree that the arbitrator will decide that, too.</p>
                <p>In addition, if you or NokOut brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated, or any party refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, any other party can ask a court to force the parties to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration). You or NokOut may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding (i.e., stay the court proceedings) while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.</p>
                <p><b>No Class Actions</b></p>
                <p>By voluntarily accepting these Terms (and in many of our Services by voluntarily clicking or tapping an in-game button to affirmatively indicate your agreement to these Terms), you and NokOut all agree that the parties can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis.</p>
                <p><b>That means:</b></p>
                <p>The parties agree that neither you nor NokOut can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action.</p>
                <p>The parties agree that the arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class, or representative arbitration proceeding (unless the parties all agree to change this).</p>
                <p>The parties agree that the arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other NokOutplayers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other players.</p>
                <p>If this subsection on “No Class Actions” is found to not be enforceable or valid, then the entire Section 14 (Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver) will be null and void (i.e., go away). But the rest of the Terms and Feature Terms will still apply.</p>
                <p><b>Opting out of the Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver</b></p>
                <p>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions in Section 14 by sending us written notice of your decision to opt-out through Help Center. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Services or availability of this opt-out, whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes as set out in this Section 14. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, NokOut too will not be bound by them.</p>
                <p><b>Changes to Section 14 Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver</b></p>
                <p>We will give you 60-days’ notice by email or through the Services if we change this Section 14 on our Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver. If this subsection on “Changes to Section 14 on Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver” is found to not be enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from Section 14 , and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Services.</p>
                <p><b>Survival</b></p>
                <p>This Section 14 shall survive termination of these Terms.</p>
